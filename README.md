<h1>Logic Gate Simulator</h1>

<p>This is a logic gate simulator that allows users to design and simulate digital circuits using fundamental logic gates such as AND, OR, XOR, Half adder, and Full adder. The simulator provides an intuitive interface for creating and visualizing circuits, and supports binary inputs and outputs.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To use the simulator

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/rohansx/logic-gate-simulator.git</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To launch the simulator, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and run the index.html file</p>


<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>If you encounter any bugs or issues while using the simulator, please open an issue in the issue tracker. Be sure to include a detailed description of the problem, as well as any error messages or steps to reproduce the issue.</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>We have several ideas for expanding the functionality of the simulator, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implementing a NOT gate</li>
  <li>Adding support for different data types</li>
  <li>Including more complex logic gates</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to contribute to any of these efforts, please let us know!</p>
